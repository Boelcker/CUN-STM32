This AddOn hast two main functions:


Using Maple-CUL-AddOns without MAPLE-CUL
========================================
A) Base: USR-TCP232-E2 wit two UARTs or hopefully T2 (only one UART)
Important: This Board with LAN Module comes on top of all others...



MAPLE-CUL AddOn for OneWire and RS485
A) Onewire with DS2480 at the last UART of the MAPLE (UART2 can handle 5V without Levelshifter)
B) RS485 via Arduino and MAX487 or similar


Status: Not tested.

Todo: Check of separation of the connectors for RS485 and OneWire for parallel usage...
